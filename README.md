## 4. What just happened 🤯✨? (Quick FAQ)

**Q: What just happened?**  
**A:** The CLI reads the functional design (FDS) from ./inputs/functional-design and generates a.o PLC Code to ./outputs

**Q: Is this for real projects?**  
**A:** YES! This is not a research project.  
This workflow is already used by multiple teams to bring real projects to production.  
The focus is on Food, Pharma, Fine Chemicals and other process manufacturing.   
From small skids to multi-plant standardizations.

**Q: The textual FDS looks cumbersome to edit.**  
**A:** This is only for demonstration and Agentic usage.  
There is a collaborative and convenient GUI Editor available by subscribing on acceleer.com

**Q: How to get started?**  
**A:** This repo is only for blueprints sharing and demonstration purposes. For real projects subscribe on acceleer.com

**Q: Is there a community edition?**  
**A:** Yes, reserved for open-source and educational projects.
